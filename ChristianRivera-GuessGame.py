#Generate a random number between one and 50
#Get a number (input) from the user
#Compare the number to input  #Operators and Recasters say true if its the same say false if not
#add "higher or "lower" operators
#add 5 guesses
#make a variable to count the number of guesses says 5 guesses goes down
